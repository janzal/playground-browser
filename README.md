Playground-browser
==================

Browserify compatible. It is an usefull set of JavaScript functions for printing texts, tables, progress bars, pictures, charts (ChartJS dep needed) and more.

In other words, it just adds childs to document.body without the need of writing JavaScript boilerplate.

It is used by [Playground](http://github.com/tajo/playground). 

Just checkout the source code - the usage and functionality is pretty obvious!
